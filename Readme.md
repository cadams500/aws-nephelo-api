#Amazon Webservices Library

##Overview

NOTE: This library is in the very early stages.

A high-level library used to interface to Amazon Web Services.
This library is heavily influenced by the excellent [typica](http://code.google.com/p/typica/) SQS library.

So why another library?  

  *  For one, typica no longer seems to be actively maintained and Amazon AWS is constantly moving forward. 
  *  Second, some things which one would expect to be easy within typica, actually take quite a bit of work to accomplish (such as setting policies). 
  *  Lastly, Amazon Web Services are just fun to play with.

The library also provides standard Java Queue implementations for SQS and a robus Listener/Notifier implementation for SNS.
